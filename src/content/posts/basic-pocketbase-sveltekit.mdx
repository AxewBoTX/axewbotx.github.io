# How to integrate Pocketbase with a basic SvelteKit project

Pocketbases is an open source, backend and database provider.<br/>
The easiest way of integrating pocketbase with SSR in sveltekit is by using `hooks` in sveltekit.
Just follow the steps given below:-

1. Make sure you have `pocketbase` installed in your project.
2. create a `src/hooks.server.js` file and put the following code in it:-

   ```js
   import { redirect } from "@sveltejs/kit";
   import Pocketbase from "pocketbase";

   export const handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
     event.locals.pb = new Pocketbase("PB_URL");
     event.locals.pb.authStore.loadFromCookie(
       event.request.headers.get("cookie") || "",
     );
     if (event.locals.pb.authStore.isValid) {
       event.locals.user = structuredClone(event.locals.pb.authStore.model);
     } else {
       event.locals.user = undefined;
     }

     const response = await resolve(event);
     response.headers.set(
       "set-cookie",
       event.locals.pb.authStore.exportToCookie({ secure: false }),
     );

     return response;
   };
   ```

   A simple explanation of this is that in the firstly it creates a pocketbase instance and then it loads any auth token present in cookies(if any).
   Then it checks if the auth token is valid and if it is then that user is set `locals.user` otherwise the `locals.user` is set to undefined.
   After that the event is resolved i.e the request by the browser is fulfilled and then the auth token from the current auth state is exported to cookies.

3. Now you can use `event.locals.pb` or `event.locals.user` in any of your `+page.server.js` or `server.js` file actions or load functions.
4. If any user now logs in then the auth state and token is managed by `hooks.server.js`'s handle function.
