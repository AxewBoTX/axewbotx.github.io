# How to properly redirect to pages in SvelteKit

[Redirecting](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/redirects) means navigating from one route to another route programatically in both SSR and CSR.<br/>
SvelteKit provides a very easy way to do so. You can just use the following code snippet whenever you want to redirect the end user to some route:-

```js
throw redirect(STATUS_CODE, ROUTE);
```

Here, `ROUTE` is the URL to which you want to redirect the user and `STATUS_CODE` is a special code that performs a specific function while redirecting.<br/>
A few of the status codes are given below:-

- 303 -> For form actions, following a successfull submission
- 307 -> For temporary redirects
- 308 -> For permanent redirects
