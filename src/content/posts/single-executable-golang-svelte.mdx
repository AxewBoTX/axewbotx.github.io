## How to make a single executable golang + svelte web app

1. Start a single golang app by going into an empty folder and executing

   ```bash
   go mod init <project-name> && touch main.go
   ```

   This will create a simple golang project and `main.go` file in which we can start writing our app.

> For this example I will be using [gofiber](https://gofiber.io/) but you can use your preffered golang web framework
