# How to setup eslint for a basic React project

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is an open source project that statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems.<br/>

Firstly you need to install required packages for your eslint setup
> You can use any package manager you like, I am using [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
```sh
bun add -D eslint eslint-plugin-react
```

Now that the required packages are installed just create a `.eslintrc.json` file in your project root.<br/>
Now just put the following code inside that file
```json
{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2021": true,
    "node": true
  },
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended"],
  "plugins": ["react"],
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": "latest",
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "off",
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
    "react/prop-types": "off"
  }
}
```

This just prepares a simple eslint setup for a basic react project, if you want you can customise it however you like.
