# How to make a single executable golang + javascript web app

In this post im gonna show you how you can make a golang web app using svelte which will combine

Start a single golang app by going into an empty folder and executing

```sh
go mod init project-name && touch main.go
```

This will create a simple golang project and `main.go` file in which we can start writing our app.
> For this example I will be using [gofiber](https://gofiber.io/) but you can use your preffered golang web framework

Add necessary golang packages by running the following commands

```sh
go add github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
```

This will add `fiber` into your project and now you are good to go.

## Golang Backend Server

Now lets hop into our `main.go` file and create a basic web app.

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
	const PORT string = ":3000"
	server := fiber.New(fiber.Config{
		AppName: "project-name",
	})

	server.Listen(PORT)
}
```

Above code will start a basic gofiber server on `localhost:3000` but in order to see anything when we visit that url we need to configure routes.<br/>

We can just add a simple route handler after creating the server, that will listen to `GET` requests to any page and just send ***Hello, World*** as a response.

```go
server.Get("*", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
	return c.Status(fiber.StatusOK).JSON("Hello, World!");
})
```

## JS Frontend App

Now that we have got a simple gofiber server up and running we can move on to the frontend part of the job. In this example im just gonna make a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) but you can use any framework you want, all you need is to get the static .html files in the build directory and it will work.

Open your terminal and create a new directory for UI inside the main directory.
You can name it anything but im gonna name it `/UI`. Go into that directory and run the following command to create svelte app using vite.

>I really love using [bun](https://bun.sh/) so im gonna use that, but any other package manager will also do the job perfectly

```sh
bun create vite .
```

You can choose the following options in vite

```sh
✔ Project name: project-name
✔ Select a framework: › Svelte
✔ Select a variant: › JavaScript
```
This will create a simple svelte frontend app in the `/UI` directory.<br/>

You can make any type of web app you want now. When you are done, you can just run

```sh
bun vite build
```
This will generated the `dist` directory and that is the directory we are gonna be embedding into our golang backend server.

## Embedding Web App
Create a simple `embed.go` file in your frontend app directory and write the following lines of code in it

```go
package UI // This can be whatever the name of your frontend folder was

import (
	"embed"
)

//go:embed all:dist
var DistDir embed.FS
```

In this file, every single line is important, even the comment. This is because the commend is what takes in the build directory i.e `dist` and embeds it into the `DistDir` variable.<br/>

Now that we have defined the `embed.go` file, we can go back to our `main.go` file and implement simple filesystem to render these static files onto the gofiber app.<br/>
We can just use our previously created route for this.

```go
server.Use("*", filesystem.New(filesystem.Config{
	Root:       http.FS(UI.DistDir),
	PathPrefix: "dist", //The name of your build folder in your frontend app
	Browse:     true,
}))
```

Abover code will take the embedded dist folder from the DistDir variable from the `/UI/embed.go` file and host a filesystem using `net/http` package which will render the static files onto their specifc routes as they were defined in your frontend web app.

## End Result
At the end your `main.go` file will look something like this

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
	const PORT string = ":3000"
	server := fiber.New(fiber.Config{
		AppName: "project-name",
	})

	server.Use("*", filesystem.New(filesystem.Config{
		Root:       http.FS(UI.DistDir),
		PathPrefix: "dist", //The name of your build folder in your frontend app
		Browse:     true,
	}))

	server.Listen(PORT)
}
```

Your `UI/embed.go` file will look like this

```go
package UI // This can be whatever the name of your frontend folder was

import (
	"embed"
)

//go:embed all:dist
var DistDir embed.FS
```
