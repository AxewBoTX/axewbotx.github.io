# How to setup WSL2 from scratch

In this post im going to show you can easily setup [WSL2(Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) from scratch on your Windows machine.<br/>
Linux is the best tool for every productivity and work related thing, but when you just want to sit back and play some games, linux can be a bit horrifying. <br/>
WSL offers you a way to use the power of both worlds together in your own computer.

## Setting Up WSL2

1. Open **Turn Windows Features on or off**
2. A dialog box will open, turn on **Virtual Machine Platform** and **Windows Subsystem For Linux** and click Ok.
3. Restart your computer.
5. Install [wsl2kernel](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel)
6. Restart Your Computer

Now that you have installed WSL we are ready to move onto the linux distro part.

## Installing Distro on Windows System Drive

This is the easy way. You can just install most of the distro from the Microsoft Store.<br/>
If your preferred distro is not on the Microsoft Store, then you can just search about that on google and you are sure to find it.

## Installing Distro on Custom Location

If you have want to install WSL distro on any other hard drive than the System Drive, then you can follow the steps below.

1. Make a folder called **WSL** in whichever directory you want.
2. Make a another folder and name it to the name of distro that you want to install.
3. Go to [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#downloading-distributions) page and download whichever distro you want.
4. Extract the downloaded file. You will see many files, just extract the the file with **x64** in its name into a new folder.
5. Make sure there is a .tar.gz file in that folder.
6. Run the Following command to install WSL on that drive:-
	```sh
	wsl --import Name_For_Distro "/location/where/you/want/to/install/it" "path/to/.tar.gz/file"
	```
7. Run the command below to start WSL
	```sh
	wsl -d Name_For_Distro
	```

You have successfully installed a linux distro onto a custom location in WSL.

## Arch Linux On WSL2

Arch linux is one of the most amazing linux distro ever. But it can be a little bit hard to install and setup, but on WSL it is pretty straight forward.

First we need to download the Arch WSL `.tar file`. You can download it from [yuk7/ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL) repo and follow this post to install it anywhere you like.

> For Arch prefer installing it in a custom location, for some reason it can cause a few annoying errors if you install it on default location.

After installing ArchWSL onto WSL, just follow the steps below to set it up.

1. We need to setup a main user for the WSL distro. Run the command below to enter the user config file.
	```sh
	EDITOR=vim visudo
	```
2. Now uncomment the following line
	```
	%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
	```
3. Now run below command to add the user to wheel group that we just configured.
	```sh
	useradd -m -G wheel {user}
	```
4. Now exit Arch from WSL using `exit` command enter again via below command
	```sh
	wsl -u {user} -d Name_For_Distro
	```
5. Run the below command to setup keyring, append all the necessary keys to the keyring and finish the keyring setup.
	```sh
	sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate && sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring
	```
6. Make sure to upgrade the whole system by running
	```sh
	sudo pacman -Syyu
	```

Now you can use Arch linux on WSL as you please.
