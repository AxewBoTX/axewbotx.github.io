# How to fix the Windows titlebar dark theme issue
Windows is a great operating system for those who don't know about or can't adjust properly to some aspects of linux. But, the windows titlebar can sometimes be a bit bitchy about dark theme.<br/>
I think anyone who has used Windows 10 or 11 can agree that sometimes while using dark mode, the titlebar will change back to light mode and then it's really annoying to get it back to dark mode.<br/>
Even your entire desktop has been in dark mode since you can remember, but suddenly your titlebar is in light mode. It's really really annoying. You can easily fix it.

1. Go to color settings and turn off the "Show Accent Color On Title Bars And Window Borders" option.
2. Open "Registory Editor".
3. Open 'Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\DWM'
4. Open 'AccentColor' and set the value to 'ec000000' and save it.
5. Create Or Open `DWORD(32-bit)` key 'AccentColorInactive' and set the value to ec000000
6. Open 'ColorPrevalence' and set the value to 1 and save it.
7. Open 'EnableWindowsColorization' and set the value to 0.

After doing the above steps, you might have noticed that you already have a pure black title bar.
>If it still don't work, all you need to do is just restart your computer.
