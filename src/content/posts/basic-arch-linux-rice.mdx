# How to setup a basic Arch linux rice.

In this post I'm going to show you how you can setup a basic Arch linux rice for development and programming.
>This is not an in-depth tutorial on how to rice arch linux, this is just a tutorial for how to setup Arch linux for my own [dotfiles](https://github.com/axewbotx/dotfiles)

## Shell

Before we do anything, we need to setup our shell.<br/>
1. You can install [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell#:~:text=The%20Z%20shell%20(Zsh)%20is,Z%20shell) by running following command
	> When you are asked for the shell, just enter /bin/zsh
	```sh
	sudo pacman -S zsh && \
	chsh
	```
2. You can install the needed packages by running the following command
	```sh
	sudo pacman -S exa fd fzf && \
	sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)" && \
	git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions && \
	git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/powerlevel10k && \
	echo 'source ~/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme' >>~/.zshrc && \
	```
3. Now you need to clone my dotfiles repo and copy everything from there to the `~/.config` folder.
4. Then run the following command to get the pre-setup `.zshrc` into your home directory
	```sh
	rm -rf ~/.zshrc && \
	cp ~/.config/zsh/.zshrc ~/
	```
5. Now just run the following command to source everything that we just installed
	```sh
	source ~/.zshrc
	```
> You can run `p10k configure` to configure powerline10k to your needs

## IMPORTANT

While reading rest of this post I assume that you have already done the following things:-
1. Install Arch linux with [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/) on your system.
2. Cloned and copied all the files from my [dotfiles](https://github.com/axewbotx/dotfiles) repo to your `.config` folder
3. You have [unzip](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/unzip/) and [curl](https://curl.se/) installed

## Font

It's always good to have a nice font installed on your system. I [Jet Brains Mono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) custom patched by [nerd font patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts?tab=readme-ov-file#font-patcher).
1. Install fontforge by using the following command
	```sh
	sudo pacman -S fontforge
	```
2. Create a folder name `FontPatcher` anywhere you like
3. Go into that folder and run the following command
	```sh
	curl -LO https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/FontPatcher.zip && \
	curl -LO https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/JetBrainsMono.zip
	```
4. Now run the following the following command to extract these
	```sh
	mkdir -p JetBrains && \
	unzip FontPatcher.zip && \
	unzip -q JetBrainsMono.zip -d JetBrains
	```
5. Now that we have all the files we need, just run the following command to patch the font
	```sh
	fontforge -script font-patcher -c --name [name-that-you-want-for-font] ./JetBrains/JetBrainsMonoNLNerdFont-Regular.ttf
	```
6. Now that we have the font ready, you can just run the following command to add it to your system's fonts
	```sh
	sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/fonts && \
	sudo mv [name-that-you-want-for-font] /usr/loacl/share/fonts
	```
