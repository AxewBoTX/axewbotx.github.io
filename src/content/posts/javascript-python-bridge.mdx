# How to make a bridge between a javascript and python program

We can easily run a python script in a javascript program by using the [child_process](https://www.npmjs.com/package/child_process) package.<br/>

## Python End

```py
import sys
print("Arguments are:", sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
```

## Javascript End

```js
import { spawn } from "child_process";

const args = ["argument_1", "argument_2"];
const pythonProcess = spawn("python", ["./index.py", ...args]);

pythonProcess.stdout.on("data", (data) =>
	console.log(data.toString());
});
```

On the javascript end, we spawn a process that runs the python script and supplies the specific arguments to it.<br/>
On the python side, we can use those arguments supplied to us by the javascript end in order to perform some actions, in this case we just print those out to the standard output.<br/>
Then again on the javascript end we can listen for data from the python side, in this case we can take the standard output from python script as input to the javascript end, and then we just print it out.
