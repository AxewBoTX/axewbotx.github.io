# How to load data in SvelteKit

There are various ways of [loading data](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load) in SvelteKit but the best and most popular is using the `load` functions in `+page.js` or `+page.serve.js` file.<br/>
Just follow the steps given below:-

1. Create a `+page.server.js` or `+page.js` file in the route folder for which you want to load data.
2. Add the follow code in it:-

   ```js
   export const load = async (event) => {
     return {};
   };
   ```

   This functions runs everytime the page loads and hence the data via this functions is provided to the page everytime it loads.<br/>
   You can fetch and then return any type of data inside this function.

3. The data that is returned in the `load` functions can be accessed from `+page.svelte` file by using the following code snippet:-

   ```svelte
   <script>
   export let data;
   </script>
   ```

   From here you can use that `data` on the frontend in whichever way you want to use it.

4. You can also [Stream With Data](https://svelte.dev/blog/streaming-snapshots-sveltekit) in order to display some kind of loading UI or skeleton loading while fetching data for your page.

5. While returning data in `load` function you can use the following code snippet to stream data:-

	```js
	export const load = async (event) => {
		async function getSomeData() {
			return someData;
		}
		return {
			streamed:{
				someData: getSomeData()
			}
		};
	};
	```

   The `streamed.someData` here can be awaited on the frontend in order to show some kind of loading UI.

6. You can use the following code snippet to utilize this `streamed.someData` on the frontend:-

   ```svelte
   <script>
   export let data;
   </script>

   {#await data.streamed.someData}
       <div>...LoadingUI...</div>
   {:then someData}
       <div>...Final UI</div>
   {/await}
   ```
