# How to setup a basic DaisyUI Theme Switcher

[DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) The most popular component library for [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). But sadly it does not have much support for changing the themes of your app from inside your app.<br/>
But there is a simple way in which this can be achieved using [local-storage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp), you can check it out on [spences10/sveltekit-theme-switch-example](https://github.com/spences10/sveltekit-theme-switch-example).<br/>
Just follow these simple steps:-

1. In your `tailwind.config.js` file make sure that you have your themes listed and properly configured. After doing that your `tailwind.config.js` file should have a small section like this:-

   > NOTE: For more help regarding making custom themes just visit DaisyUI website.

   ```js
   export default {
     content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js,svelte,ts}"],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [require("daisyui")],
     daisyui: {
       themes: [
         {
           dark: {
             primary: "#b6e1ef",
             secondary: "#96a0f7",
             accent: "#dda06a",
             neutral: "#302037",
             "base-100": "#313235",
             info: "#4d98d1",
             success: "#115548",
             warning: "#f2c218",
             error: "#df3a68",
           },
           light: {
             primary: "#f911a4",
             secondary: "#305dd1",
             accent: "#66b1c4",
             neutral: "#231726",
             "base-100": "#eef2f6",
             info: "#5eaee4",
             success: "#47e1c5",
             warning: "#f5d56b",
             error: "#ed7375",
           },
         },
       ],
     },
   };
   ```

2. Now make a writable store anywhere in your `src` directory, I generaly prefer placing all my stores in a `stores.js` file in `src/lib` directory.<br/>
   In that file just add the following lines for code:-

   ```js
   import { writable } from "svelte/store";

   export const AppTheme = writable("dark");
   ```

3. Now make another file in that same directory named `setTheme.js` and the following code in it:-

   ```js
   import { AppTheme } from "./stores";

   const themes = ["dark", "light"];
   export function setTheme(theme) {
     if (themes.includes(theme)) {
       const one_year = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365;
       window.localStorage.setItem("theme", theme);
       document.cookie = `theme=${theme}; max-age=${one_year}; path=/; SameSite=Lax`;
       document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", theme);
       AppTheme.set(theme);
     }
   }
   ```

4. Now make sure that the `html` tag in your `app.html` file has following code added to it:-

   ```html
   <html data-theme="">
     ...
   </html>
   ```

5. Now make a `+layout.svelte` file in your `src/routes` directory and add the following code to it:-

   > NOTE: Here I am using the '@' path alias so make sure to change that to whatever is fit for you and if you want to know how to use aliases in your project, there is tutorial in the `js-path-alias` file in this folder.

   ```js
   <script>
     import { onMount } from "svelte";
     import { AppTheme } from "@/lib/stores.js";

     const themes = ["dark", "light"];
     onMount(() => {
       if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
         const theme = window.localStorage.getItem("theme");
         if (theme && themes.includes(theme)) {
           document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", theme);
           AppTheme.set(theme);
         }
       }
     });
   </script>
   ```

6. Now here is a simple example on how to use the end product:-

   > NOTE: This will add the theme to local-storage of your site, so you can also check it out in the browser.

	```svelte
   <script>
     import { AppTheme } from "@/lib/stores.js";
     import { setTheme } from "@/lib/setTheme.js";
     const handleClick = () => {
       if ($AppTheme == "dark") {
         setTheme("light");
       } else if ($AppTheme == "light") {
         setTheme("dark");
       }
     };
   </script>

   <div>
     <button on:click={handleClick} class="btn">Click</button>
   </div>
   ```
