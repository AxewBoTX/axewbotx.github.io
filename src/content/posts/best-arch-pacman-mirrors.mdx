# How to get the best Arch linux pacman mirrors
Arch linux is pretty great, but sometimes it can be really annoying. <br/>
Many times after installing arch linux, and even doing everything perfectly, `pacman` may result with very slow download and upload speeds.<br/>

We can easily fix this issue by using the [rate-mirrors](https://github.com/westandskif/rate-mirrors) package. It is a simple program that finds the fastest pacman mirrors for arch linux.

You can install that package using the AUR helper [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)
```sh
yay -S rate-mirrors
```
This will install the rate-mirrors program onto your system and now you can use it easily.

If you just want the list of best pacman mirrors you can get that by 
```sh
rate-mirrors arch
```

But if you want to get the list of pacman mirrors and also apply them to your pacman, you can run
```sh
rate-mirrors --allow-root arch | sudo tee /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```
